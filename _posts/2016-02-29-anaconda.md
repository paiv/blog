This is a follow-up on my ["scientific computing" setup] [PREV-POST] for [CS231n] class. For now, I'm not using Anaconda, but here are the steps that will get you going.

[Anaconda] integrates package manager (`pip`) and environment manager (`virtualenv`) into a consistent experience.

Note that I didn't want for `conda` be in `PATH` by default, since it overrides `python`, and also used non-default install path.

Setup:

```shell
# I used non-default install path
sudo mkdir /opt/local/var/miniconda
sudo chown user /opt/local/var/miniconda

curl -O https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

# When asked, I used /opt/local/var/miniconda/miniconda2
bash Miniconda-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

# I refused to change .bashrc, so I can update PATH only when needed:
export PATH=/opt/local/var/miniconda/miniconda2/bin:$PATH

conda update conda
```

Switch into a virtual environment, and install packages:

```shell
conda create --name cs231n ipython
source activate cs231n
conda install --name numpy scipy matplotlib notebook
```

From here you have a notebook server:

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

... opens http://127.0.0.1:8888
